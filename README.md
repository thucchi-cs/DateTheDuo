Date the Duo is a mix of a game show and a dating simulator where the users compete against one another to win the love of the ultimate bachelor: Duo the Duolingo bird. 

This project was completed for Hack Club's Hackathon Parthenon (2025). The front end was created using Next.js and the back end was created using Node.js. We used WebSocket to connect devices together.
We created this project because we wanted to code something silly, fun, and creative. 
To play, go to this link **PLACEHOLDER**. Once 'new game' is selected by the user, up to 3 additional players may click 'join game' and use the code provided by the game host. The objective of this game is to correctly answer more trivia questions than your opponents, resulting in winning the game (a date with Duo).   

All pixel art (sprites/backgrounds) was created by Jade Piko using ibisPaint X. All rights to Duo belong to Duolingo, Inc. All fonts originate from Google Fonts. 

Made with love by a three girl team who met each other the day before creating this game. XOXO Jade Piko, Azra Ali, and Chi Do.
